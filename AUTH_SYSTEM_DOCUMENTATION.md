# Comprehensive Authentication System Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the end-to-end authentication system implemented in the AI Chat application. The system is built on Supabase Auth with additional security layers and follows industry best practices.

## System Architecture

The authentication system follows a layered architecture with the following components:

1. **Client-Side Authentication** - React hooks and context providers
2. **Server-Side Authentication** - Middleware and server-side functions
3. **Database Security** - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
4. **API Protection** - JWT-based route protection
5. **Session Management** - Secure cookie handling

## Key Components

### 1. Authentication Service (`src/lib/auth-service.ts`)

This service provides server-side authentication functions:

- `createServerClient()` - Creates a Supabase client for server-side operations
- `getSession()` - Retrieves the current user session
- `getUser()` - Retrieves the current user
- `protectApiRoute()` - Protects API routes
- `checkAuth()` - Server-side authentication check with redirect
- `checkGuest()` - Server-side guest check (for auth pages)

### 2. Authentication Hook (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`)

This custom React hook provides client-side authentication:

- Session management with real-time updates
- Email/password authentication
- OAuth integration (Google, GitHub, Discord)
- Error handling and loading states
- Automatic redirect handling

### 3. Authentication Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

This context provider makes authentication state available throughout the application:

- Wraps the entire application in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Provides a consistent API for authentication operations
- Handles session persistence across page navigations

### 4. Authentication Middleware (`src/lib/auth-middleware.ts`)

This middleware handles authentication at the server level:

- `updateSession()` - Updates session cookies
- `authMiddleware()` - Protects routes based on authentication status
- `protectApiRoute()` - Protects API endpoints
- `checkPermission()` - Handles role-based access control

### 5. Protected Layout (`src/app/chat-session/layout.tsx`)

This layout component ensures only authenticated users can access protected routes:

- Server-side authentication check
- Automatic redirect to login for unauthenticated users

## Authentication Flow

### 1. User Registration

1. User visits `/auth/signup`
2. User fills out registration form with email, password, and username
3. Client-side validation ensures password strength and email format
4. `signUp()` function called with user credentials
5. Supabase creates user account and sends verification email
6. User redirected to verification page

### 2. Email/Password Login

1. User visits `/auth/login`
2. User selects email authentication method
3. User enters email and password
4. Client-side validation ensures proper format
5. `signInWithPassword()` function called
6. Supabase validates credentials
7. Session created and stored in secure cookies
8. User redirected to `/chat-session`

### 3. OAuth Login

1. User visits `/auth/login`
2. User selects OAuth authentication method
3. User clicks on desired OAuth provider (Google, GitHub, Discord)
4. `signInWithOAuth()` function called
5. User redirected to provider's authentication page
6. Provider redirects back to `/auth/callback`
7. Supabase handles OAuth token exchange
8. Session created and stored in secure cookies
9. User redirected to `/chat-session`

### 4. Session Management

1. AuthProvider listens for auth state changes
2. Session automatically refreshed when expired
3. Real-time updates to authentication state
4. Proper cleanup on signout

### 5. Protected Route Access

1. Middleware checks authentication status for protected routes
2. Unauthenticated users redirected to login page
3. Authenticated users redirected from login to protected pages
4. Server-side validation in layout components

### 6. API Protection

1. `protectApiRoute()` middleware validates JWT tokens
2. Only authenticated users can access protected API endpoints
3. User context passed to API handlers

## Security Features

### 1. Session Security

- HttpOnly, Secure cookies
- Automatic token refresh
- PKCE flow for OAuth
- Session expiration handling

### 2. Password Security

- Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- Server-side validation
- Secure storage with Supabase Auth

### 3. Database Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Service role key only used on server
- Anon key only used on client

### 4. Communication Security

- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Secure headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)

### 5. Rate Limiting

- Authentication endpoint protection
- OTP request limiting
- Brute force protection

## Error Handling

- End-to-end tests for user journeys
- Security testing for protected routes

## Deployment

The system is configured for both development and production:

- Environment-specific configuration
- Secure credential storage
- Proper redirect URL configuration
- Production-ready security settings

## Customization

The system can be easily customized:

- Additional OAuth providers
- Custom authentication flows
- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication

## Monitoring

The system includes monitoring capabilities:

- Authentication event logging
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Security incident detection

## Compliance

The system follows security best practices:

- OWASP recommendations
- GDPR compliance
- Privacy by design
- Secure coding practices
