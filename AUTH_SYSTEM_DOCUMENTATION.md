## Overview

The authentication system provides secure user registration, login, and session management for the Chat application. It leverages Supabase Auth as the core authentication provider with custom enhancements for improved security and user experience.

## Authentication Methods

### Email/Password Authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Password strength requirements (8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Email verification for new accounts
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts

### OAuth Authentication
- Google OAuth integration
- Secure token exchange and validation
- Automatic account linking for existing users
- Profile information synchronization

## Security Implementation

### Password Security
- Minimum 8-character passwords with complexity requirements
- Server-side password validation
- Automatic password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts

### Session Security
- JWT-based session tokens
- HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies
- Automatic token refresh
- Session expiration and cleanup

### Data Protection
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure API endpoint protection
- Environment-based configuration separation

## Session Management

### Token Handling
- Access tokens for API authentication
- Refresh tokens for session persistence
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Secure storage in HttpOnly cookies

### Session Lifecycle
- Login creates new session with tokens
- Logout invalidates tokens and clears cookies
- Automatic session extension during activity
- Graceful expiration handling with redirects

## API Security

### Protected Routes
- Middleware-based route protection
- JWT verification for authenticated endpoints
- Role-based access control
- Request rate limiting

### Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options protection
- X-Content-Type-Options enforcement
- Referrer Policy configuration

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors
- Invalid credentials feedback
- Account lockout notifications
- Email verification requirements
- OAuth provider errors

### Security Errors
- CSRF protection failures
- Token validation errors
- Session expiration handling
- Rate limit exceeded responses

## Environment Configuration

### Required Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3003
```

### Security Settings
- Cookie domain and path configuration
- Token expiration times
- Rate limiting thresholds
- Password policy settings

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Authentication flow validation
- Password validation testing
- Session management tests
- Error handling verification

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end login/logout flows
- OAuth provider integration
- Protected route access control
- API endpoint security

The system is configured for both development and production:
- Development: Local testing with localhost URLs
- Production: Secure HTTPS endpoints with proper domain configuration

This authentication system provides a comprehensive, secure, and scalable solution for the Chat application. It demonstrates best practices in authentication design, implementation, and security while maintaining a great user experience.
