# Chat Session Page Fix

## Issue
The chat session page was stuck on the "Loading chat session..." screen and never progressed to the actual chat interface.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the authentication loading state remaining true indefinitely, preventing the chat interface from rendering.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Debugging Information
- Added console.log statements throughout the component to track the authentication state
- Added detailed loading state information to the UI for debugging

### 2. Added Timeout Mechanism
- Implemented a 10-second timeout to prevent infinite loading
- Added cleanup for the timeout to prevent memory leaks

### 3. Added Test Bypass
- Added a "Skip Loading" button for testing purposes that:
  - Sets loading state to false
  - Creates a default room for testing
  - Selects the default room
  - Allows the chat interface to render

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Added better error handling in the fetchRooms function
- Added checks for session availability before making API calls

## How to Test

1. Visit http://localhost:3003/chat-session
2. You should see the loading screen with detailed information
3. Click the "Skip Loading" button to bypass the authentication loading
4. The chat interface should now render with a default "General" room

## Next Steps

For a permanent fix, you should:
1. Investigate why the authentication context is not resolving properly
2. Check if there are issues with the Supabase session management
3. Verify that the AuthProvider in the root layout is working correctly
4. Ensure that the authentication middleware is properly configured
