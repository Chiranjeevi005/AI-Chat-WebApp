# Data Isolation and Security Implementation

## Overview

This document explains how the AI Chat App implements user-specific data isolation and maintains professional data security practices.

## Current Implementation

### 1. User Authentication and Session Management
- All API requests are authenticated through Supabase Auth
- User sessions are securely managed with JWT tokens
- Session data is encrypted and stored securely

### 2. Message Data Isolation
- Each message is associated with a `sender_id` that links to the authenticated user
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access their own messages
- Messages are stored with proper foreign key relationships to both rooms and users

### 3. Room Management
- Rooms are created through an admin API endpoint that bypasses RLS for creation
- All users can view all rooms (shared room model)
- Message activity within rooms is user-specific and properly isolated

## Data Security Measures

### 1. Database Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforced on all tables
- Service role keys used only in server-side operations
- User-facing operations use anonymous keys with limited permissions

### 2. API Security
- All API endpoints validate user authentication
- Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints
- Error messages are generic to prevent information leakage

### 3. User Data Protection
- User profiles contain only necessary information
- No sensitive data is stored in plain text
- All communications use HTTPS encryption

## User-Specific Data Management

### Messages
- Each message is tagged with the sender's user ID
- Users can only read messages they've sent or received
- Message history is maintained per user session

### Rooms
- While rooms are shared, message content within rooms is user-specific
- User participation in rooms is tracked through message activity
- Room creation is logged for audit purposes

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced User-Room Association
- Implementation of a `user_rooms` junction table to track room ownership
- User-specific room filtering based on participation or ownership
- Private room capabilities for one-on-one conversations

### 2. Advanced Data Isolation
- Implementation of user groups for team-based conversations
- Role-based access control for different room types
- Enhanced audit logging for compliance purposes

## Best Practices Followed

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only have access to data they need
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security protect user data
3. **Secure by Default**: Security measures are enabled automatically
4. **Privacy by Design**: User privacy is considered in all design decisions

## Compliance Considerations

- GDPR-ready data handling practices
- CCPA compliance for California users
- HIPAA considerations for healthcare-related conversations (if applicable)

## Audit and Monitoring

- Room creation is logged with timestamps
- Message activity is tracked for user engagement
- Error logs are maintained for security monitoring
