# React Hook Order Fix

## Issue
The chat session page was throwing a React error:
```
React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by ChatSessionPage. This will lead to bugs and errors if not fixed.
```

And also:
```
Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by declaring the `loadingTimeoutRef` useRef hook in the wrong position in the component. React requires that all hooks be called in the same order on every render, and adding a hook after other hooks had already been declared violated this rule.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Hook Order
- Moved the `loadingTimeoutRef` useRef hook to the correct position in the component
- Ensured all hooks are declared in the same order on every render
- Maintained the timeout functionality for preventing infinite loading

### 2. Preserved Functionality
- Kept the 10-second timeout to prevent infinite loading
- Maintained the cleanup effect for the timeout
- Preserved all existing functionality including the test bypass button

## Files Modified
- `src/app/chat-session/page.tsx` - Fixed hook order and maintained all functionality

## Testing
The fix has been tested and the React hook order error is no longer appearing. The chat session page now loads correctly and shows the loading screen with the test bypass button.

## Next Steps
For a permanent fix to the authentication loading issue:
1. Investigate why the AuthContext is not resolving properly
2. Check Supabase session management
3. Verify the AuthProvider configuration in the root layout
4. Ensure authentication middleware is properly set up

The hook order issue has been resolved and the chat session page should now work correctly.
