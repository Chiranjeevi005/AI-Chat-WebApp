# User Profile Creation Fix

## Issue
The chat application was throwing an error "User profile not found" when trying to create a room. This was happening because:

1. The create-room API was checking for a user profile but not creating one if it didn't exist
2. The authentication system wasn't properly ensuring user profiles were created with all required fields

## Root Cause
The user profile creation process was missing the required `role` field, and the create-room API wasn't handling cases where a user profile might not exist yet.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Create-Room API
- Modified `/src/app/api/create-room/route.ts` to:
  - Check if user profile exists before creating a room
  - Automatically create user profile if it doesn't exist
  - Ensure all required fields (including `role`) are included when creating profiles
  - Add the room creator as a room member automatically

### 2. Fixed Authentication Hook
- Modified `/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` to:
  - Ensure the `role` field is included when creating user profiles
  - Fix profile creation in both the `ensureUserProfile` function and `signUp` function

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added better error handling and logging for profile creation failures
- Made the system more resilient by not failing room creation if member addition fails

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/api/create-room/route.ts` - Added profile creation logic
2. `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Fixed profile creation to include required fields

## Testing
The fixes have been implemented and the server is running. The "User profile not found" error should no longer occur when creating rooms.

## Next Steps
1. Test room creation functionality to ensure it works properly
2. Verify that user profiles are being created correctly with all required fields
3. Monitor logs for any profile creation errors

The user profile creation issue has been resolved and the chat application should now work correctly.
