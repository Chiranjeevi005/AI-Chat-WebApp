## Database Schema

The application uses a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase with the following tables:

### Core Tables
1. **profiles**: User profile information
2. **rooms**: Chat rooms
3. **messages**: Chat messages
4. **room_members**: Room membership tracking (optional enhancement)

### Security Implementation
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- Role-based access control (admin/user)
- Service role keys for server-side operations
- Anonymous keys for client-side operations

## Authentication System

### Supported Authentication Methods
- **Email/Password**: Traditional username/password authentication
- **OAuth Integration**: Google login option
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic refresh

### Admin Functionality
The application includes a designated admin user with special privileges:
- **Email**: chiranjeevi8050@gmail.com
- **Password**: Password123

Admin users can:
- Access the admin panel at `/admin`
- Create and delete chat rooms
- Moderate messages
- Manage user permissions

## Performance Optimizations

### Real-time Performance
- Message queuing system for smoother updates
- Instant feedback for message sending
- Efficient Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Proper cleanup of event listeners and channels

### UI/UX Optimizations
- Smooth scrolling behavior for chat messages
- Memoized callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient component rendering
- Graceful error handling without UI disruption

## Security Features

### Authentication Security
- Minimum 8-character passwords with complexity requirements
- Server-side password validation and hashing
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- JWT-based session tokens with HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies

### Data Protection
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Input validation and sanitization
- Environment-based configuration separation
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

### Network Security
- HTTPS encryption for all production traffic
- HSTS headers for production environments
- Restricted CORS policies
- CSRF protection

## Setup & Configuration

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
