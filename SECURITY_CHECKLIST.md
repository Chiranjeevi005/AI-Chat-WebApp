# Security Checklist for Chat Application

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Chat application and provides a checklist for maintaining security best practices.

## Authentication Security

### Password Security
- [x] Minimum 8-character passwords with complexity requirements
- [x] Server-side password validation
- [x] Automatic password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Rate limiting for authentication attempts
- [x] Account lockout after multiple failed attempts

### Session Security
- [x] JWT-based session tokens
- [x] HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies
- [x] Automatic token refresh
- [x] Session expiration and cleanup
- [x] Logout invalidates tokens and clears cookies

### OAuth Security
- [x] Secure token exchange and validation
- [x] Automatic account linking for existing users
- [x] Profile information synchronization
- [x] Proper redirect URI validation

## Data Protection

### Database Security
- [x] Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- [x] Input validation and sanitization
- [x] Environment-based configuration separation
- [x] Service role keys for server-side operations

### API Security
- [x] Middleware-based route protection
- [x] JWT verification for authenticated endpoints
- [x] Role-based access control
- [x] Request rate limiting
- [x] Secure API endpoint protection

### Client-Side Security
- [x] Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [x] X-Frame-Options protection
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options enforcement
- [x] Referrer Policy configuration
- [x] CSRF protection

## Network Security

### HTTPS
- [x] All production traffic encrypted with HTTPS
- [x] HSTS headers for production environments
- [x] Secure redirect from HTTP to HTTPS

### CORS
- [x] Restricted CORS policies
- [x] Origin validation for API requests
- [x] Credential restrictions for cross-origin requests

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors
- [x] Invalid credentials feedback without information disclosure
- [x] Account lockout notifications
- [x] Email verification requirements
- [x] OAuth provider errors handled gracefully

### Security Errors
- [x] CSRF protection failures
- [x] Token validation errors
- [x] Session expiration handling
- [x] Rate limit exceeded responses

## Environment Configuration

### Sensitive Data
- [x] Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- [x] .gitignore prevents credential leakage
- [x] Separate configurations for development and production
- [x] Regular credential rotation procedures

### Required Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3003
```

## Testing and Monitoring

### Security Testing
- [x] Authentication flow validation
- [x] Password validation testing
- [x] Session management tests
- [x] Error handling verification
- [x] End-to-end login/logout flows
- [x] OAuth provider integration testing
- [x] Protected route access control
- [x] API endpoint security testing

### Monitoring
- [x] Authentication attempt logging
- [x] Failed login attempt tracking
- [x] Security event monitoring
- [x] Regular security audits

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- [ ] Keep dependencies up to date
- [ ] Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Apply security patches promptly
- [ ] Review and update security policies

### Best Practices
- [ ] Regular security training for developers
- [ ] Code review for security implications
